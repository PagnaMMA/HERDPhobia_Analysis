# HERDPhobia Hate Speech Detection: Model Fine-tuning and Analysis

## Introduction

This report details the fine-tuning of an Afrocentric pretrained language model for hate speech detection in Hausa language. The experiment uses the HERDPhobia dataset, which contains annotated social media text for hate speech classification.

## Dataset Analysis

The HERDPhobia dataset consists of three splits:
- Training set: [X] examples
- Development set: [Y] examples
- Test set: [Z] examples

Class distribution analysis shows [describe balance/imbalance of classes].

## Methodology

### Base Model Selection
For this task, I selected [model name] as the base Afrocentric pretrained language model because [reasons for selection].

### Fine-tuning Procedure
- The model was fine-tuned on the training set using binary cross-entropy loss
- Hyperparameters: learning rate of [X], batch size of [Y], [Z] epochs
- Early stopping based on F1 score on the development set

### Performance Improvement Strategies
Several strategies were implemented to improve model performance:

1. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Applied random deletion and word swap techniques
   - Doubled the training data size

2. **Hyperparameter Optimization**:
   - Explored learning rates between [X] and [Y]
   - Batch sizes of [Z]
   - Added learning rate warmup

3. **Ensemble Learning**:
   - Trained 3 models with different random seeds
   - Combined predictions using soft voting

## Results

### Baseline Performance
The initial model achieved the following scores on the test set:
- Accuracy: [X]
- F1 Score: [Y]
- Precision: [Z]
- Recall: [W]

### Improved Performance
After implementing the improvement strategies, the best model achieved:
- Accuracy: [X]
- F1 Score: [Y]
- Precision: [Z]
- Recall: [W]

### Comparison with Original Paper
| Metric | Original Paper | Our Model | Difference |
|--------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Accuracy | [X] | [Y] | [Z] |
| F1 Score | [X] | [Y] | [Z] |
| Precision | [X] | [Y] | [Z] |
| Recall | [X] | [Y] | [Z] |

## Discussion

### Performance Analysis
[Discuss why your model performs better/worse than the original paper's results]

### Effectiveness of Improvement Strategies
- Data augmentation improved F1 score by [X]
- Hyperparameter tuning improved precision by [Y]
- Ensemble learning reduced variance in predictions

### Error Analysis
Common error patterns include:
1. [Error pattern 1]
2. [Error pattern 2]
3. [Error pattern 3]

### Limitations
The model has the following limitations:
- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]
- [Limitation 3]

## Conclusion and Future Work

This project successfully fine-tuned an Afrocentric pretrained language model for hate speech detection in Hausa. The final model achieves [competitive/comparable] results to the original paper.

Future work could focus on:
1. Incorporating linguistic features specific to Hausa
2. Exploring more advanced data augmentation techniques
3. Testing the model on out-of-domain Hausa text
4. Improving the handling of [specific error cases]
